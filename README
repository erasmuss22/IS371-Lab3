This lab involves use of databases, however the database can only be accessed through the campus VPN. The first exercise shows the connectivity of a combo box to a datagridview and also allows the user to make changes to the data and save it. The second exercise acts as an ATM machine where a customer enters their account and must enter the correct pin. From their they can see their balance and make a withdrawal. The final exercise works with building queries and displaying datagridviews based on these queries. In one window the user can search entries to display the data.
